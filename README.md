# OSU-Hackathon-Project

This project uses a static `express` server.

The site uses Eventbrite API to make a webpage that lists tech events taking place in a location that the user specifies.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js
